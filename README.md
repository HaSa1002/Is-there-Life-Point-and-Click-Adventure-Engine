# Is there Life? Engine (2D Point&Click Adventures)
This project is not finished. It is under active development. The mission is to have an engine were you can easily create Point and Click Adventures, and make them interactive, as well as animated. This engine is developed for an own project, but in a general approach. Currently I am working on making the engine independent from Lua, so that we could - theoretically - implement a different scripting language. That is the reason, why it currently is not compiling. If you are interested in insights in the development, follow my [blog](https://hasa1002.github.io/).

# Features #
-	Scripting as the main part of interacting with the engine
-	Designed for 2D Point and Click Adventure
- Scripting language independency, but deliverd Lua support
- Support for Moving Objects

## In Development ##
- Editor mode [see](https://hasa1002.github.io/blog/2018/04/04/Basic-Engine/)
-	Animations


## Planned ##
-	Savegames
-	Cutscenes
-	Scriptable GUI
-	Doc
-	Multiple Platforms

## Installation ##
You need to have Visual Studio 2017 installed (however I am sure, that you can get this on every Platform running, since I am not using any windows specific librarys)
1. Clone the project
2. Install SFML version 2.5 (https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-vc.php)
