# Is there Life? Engine (2D Point&Click Adventures)
This project is not finished. It is under active development. The mission is to have an engine were you can easily create Point and Click Adventures, and make them interactive, as well as animated. This engine is developed for an own project, but in a general approach. Currently I am working on making the engine independent from Lua, so that we could - theoretically - implement a different scripting language. That is the reason, why it currently is not compiling. If you are interested in insights in the development, follow my [blog](https://hasa1002.github.io/).

# Features #
-	Scripting as the main part of interacting with the engine
-	Designed for 2D Point and Click Adventure

## In Development ##
- Editor mode [see](https://hasa1002.github.io/blog/2018/04/04/Basic-Engine/)
-	Animations
- Scripting language independency, but deliverd Lua support

## Planned ##
-	Savegames
-	Cutscenes
-	Scriptable GUI
-	Doc
-	Multiple Platforms

## Help Wanted ##
Since this is my hobby project I update here as I have time. I made this open, so that everyone can use and modify it, but to let people influence this project.
